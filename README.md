# Geometry Basics

## Problem Statement

Read through the following instructions very carefully, and make sure you check the sample input/output section to be sure you are meeting the requirements.

1. Your program should prompt the user for the users name.
2. Your program should prompt the user for the radius of a circle. 
3. Your program should prompt the user for the edge length of a cube.
4. Your program should calculate (using Math class methods when appropriate) the diameter of the circle, area of the circle, and the volume of the cube.
5. Your program should output the values you calculated in a similar format to the sample output below.
6. The last line of your programs output should be `"Hope that helped ${name}!"` where `${name}` is the users name.

## Input Description

The users name may or may not have a space on it.

The radius of the circle may or may not be a double.

The edge length of the cube will always be a whole number.

## Sample Input/Output

### Sample run 1

```
What is your name: Mr. Mankin
What is the radius of the sphere: 10.5
What is the length of the cubes edge: 5

The circles diameter of the circle is 21.0
The circles area is 346.36059
The volume of the cube is 125.0
Hope that helped Mr. Mankin!
```

### Sample run 2

```
What is your name: Mr. Schultz
What is the radius of the sphere: 2
What is the length of the cubes edge: 2

The circles diameter of the circle is 4.0
The circles area is 12.56637
The volume of the cube is 8.0
Hope that helped Mr. Schultz!
```
